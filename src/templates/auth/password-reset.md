# Reset your password

Hi {{name}},

Someone (hopefully you) requested a link to reset your password, so here you go.

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="{{ link }}" class="btn btn-outline-light" 
style="background-color:#5049cc;color:white">Reset my password</a>
</div>

Note that this link is valid for {{ minutes }} minutes only. If you didn't request this email, you can just ignore it; we won't give anyone else access to your account.
